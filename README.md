dielectric_spectroscopy_gui
=======

MATLAB scripts/functions/GUIs for reading, homogenizing and analyzing dielectric spectroscopy data collected by the Solartron platform. Optimized for analyzing ice-rich materials, but potentially adjustable to other materials.

If the format of the data input into inv_cole_gui.m (determined by load_solartron_gui.m and merge_solartron_gui.m), then inv_cole_gui.m may be used to invert dielectric spectroscopy for multiple (up to 4) Cole-Cole relaxations and DC conductivity simultaneously, with confidence bounds for each model parameter.

Manual forthcoming.
